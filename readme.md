# Microdown based help system

The help system of Pharo up until version 9 was based on help topics written using a combination of subclasses and pragma method annotations. This made it hard to understand and hence also hard to maintain. Also it was rather limited in its formatting capabilities. This help system allow help to be written in markdown files, making help topics easier to maintain and richer in its formatting capabilities. This will make the help system the important tool it was always supposed to be.


## Help system documentation
The documentation for the help system is in the [doc](doc/helpsystem.md)
